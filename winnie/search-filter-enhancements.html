        Winnie is a marketplace for child care, kids activities and backed by a
        trusted community of parents and providers.

        Winnie's search filter experience needed enhancements in order to
        increase place detail views. Analytics showed that
        <span class="highlight"> users who applied filters </span> to their
        searches created more searches on average and had a
        <span class="highlight"
          >significantly higher CTR from search results to place detail.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        <span class="highlight">Majority of users didn't utilize filters </span>
        because the <span class="highlight">affordance was hidden </span> behind
        an icon in the search tab's nav bar. This meant that most users were not
        seeing relevant search results and chose not to click-through to place
        detail. Monetization was an important consideration because the largest
        child care centers pay for lead generation.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        <span class="highlight">My hypothesis</span> was that if the utlization
        and variety of search filters was increased then it would result in more
        searches and place detail views. As a result, users would see more
        relevant search results and child care centers would receive more
        qualified leads.

      <div class="text-subheader-1">results</div>
      <p class="text-body">
        The data showed that users were...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text-body">
          Twice as likely to do a filtered child care search
        </li>
        <li class="text-body">
          Significantly more likely to see a sponsor in search results
        </li>
        <li class="text-body">Twice as likely to click through from search</li>

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">First Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        I started off by exploring different ways to expose search filter
        categories in the UI using a chip pattern. Along the way I thought of
        creating two new filter categories – price and hours because the data
        was already available on the backend.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Price data was only available in specific markets so a majority of users
        would see an empty state if they tried to apply it to their search.
        However data for an hours filter was available across many different
        markets because it's mrore standardized than price and easier to
        collect.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Within each filter category, the options would be multi-select
        checkboxes but the hours filter would be single-select radio buttons.
        The reset button would only appear if at least one filter was applied
        and would remove all applied filters.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Second Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Once I knew which filter chips would be surfaced to users, I explored
        how the options for each type of filter would be displayed. Initially I
        thought of using a classic modal without dividers but ultimately the tap
        targets were too small. Dividers were needed to clearly delineate
        sections for usability.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Another idea was to display filter options as circles within a bottom
        sheet. Circles weren't feasible long term because they limited how much
        text could be displayed inside. The bottom sheet pattern was much better
        than a modal because of better accessiblity since its located anchored
        to the bottom of the screen and easier to tap.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Ultimately I went with a bottom sheet that displayed filter options
        inside of a table view with dividers because of accessibility and
        familiarity.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        At this point, I needed to iron out how a user could filter by custom
        hours. Users could filter by a specific start time, end time or both
        using a slider. The start time limit would be 6AM and the end time limit
        would be 9PM. Each knob would increase or decrease time in one hour
        increments.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The overnight, weeekend and after care options were shortcuts for start
        and end times that a user couldn't apply using the custom hours filter.
        Since radio buttons can't be deselected, the any hours option would
        return users to the default state which includes all possible hours.
      </p>

      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Haptic feedback was added to each filter chip to create a sense of
        delight and encourage users to apply more filters so they see the most
        relevant search results. With more time I would've pushed to add a swip
        to dismiss feature for the bottom sheets.
