      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie is a marketplace for child care and backed by a trusted community
        of parents and providers.
      </p>
      <span class="text-subheader-1 highlight">project</span>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Providers on Winnie were not regularly updating their child care
        listings. Analytics showed that less than 30% of providers were updating
        their listings every month. This created a negative experience for users
        who clicked through from search results only to see outdated or missing
        information about a daycare or preschool.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        From the provider perspective, there was no visibility into how their
        listing was performing on the platform so they lacked incentive to
        update their business information. Up this point, Winnie had not
        invested in business tools for providers so it became apparent that we
        needed to create a dashboard for providers to manage their listings.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        My hypothesis was that if providers could both measure their performance
        and update their listings from a centralized dashboard, it would improve
        data quality on the platform and strengthen Winnie's long term
        relationship with providers.
      </p>
      <span class="text-subheader-1 highlight">results</span>
      <p id="margin-below-results" class="text-body">
        Launching the business dashboard increased the number of monthly edits
        made to child care listings. This improved data quality and provided
        more users with accurate information about daycares and preschools.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">First Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        I started off by thinking through the navigation on mobile web and
        desktop. On mobile web, the default state would be a table view so
        providers could see a list of all possible actions they could take on
        the dashboard. On desktop, providers would see a list of actions in a
        column to the left of the main content.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Then I thought through how to display the three key performance metrics
        for a listing — reach, views and referrals. Hovering over the
        information icon would reveal a tooltip that provided context about the
        associated metric.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Below metrics, I displayed a simple prompt to encourage providers to
        upgrade to a featured listing. These requests would get funneled to the
        sales team.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Second Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        After reflecting on how the performance metrics were displayed, I
        realized that raw numbers by themsleves weren't useful unless a provider
        could filter by time period and also see the percentage change over
        time.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Providers also needed a way to visualize their performance in a chart so
        initially I looked into a stacked bar chart. However its difficult to
        compare the length of stacked bars and when the numbers are similar or
        there is no clear trend, its harder to make inferences based on the
        data.

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Shipped Design</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        In the final design, the key performance metrics were accompanied by
        gray explainer text so that providers wouldn't have to hover over
        tooltips to understand what each metric meant.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        To make the percentage change more useful, the triangle icons were
        replaced with descriptions that also allowed me to deal with edge cases
        in the data. If there was no previous data and current data is not zero,
        the description would say "Over 100% increase from last month". If there
        was no change in the data, the description would say "Holding steady
        from last month". Otherwise the description would state the percentage
        increase or decrease.
