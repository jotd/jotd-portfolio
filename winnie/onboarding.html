      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie is a marketplace for child care and backed by a trusted community
        of parents and providers.
      </p>
      <span class="text-subheader-1 highlight">project</span>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie needed an onboarding flow to personalize the content shown to
        users in home feed. The home feed was an important lever to retain users
        not actively searching for local child care providers. Analytics
        revealed a high churn rate in users who signed up but were not in the
        market for child care.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        By default, the home feed was not personalized so users would see posts
        about a wide range of parenting topics. Although users had the
        affordance to follow and hide certain topics, very few users took
        advantage of this feature.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body"></p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        My hypothesis was that if the home feed was personalized based on
        information collected in onboarding, there would be increased engagement
        and content contribution in feed.
      </p>
      <span class="text-subheader-1 highlight">results</span>
      <p id="margin-below-results" class="text-body">
        Users who provided the age of their kids during onboarding were almost
        twice as likely to like a post and create content – includes posts,
        reviews, and replies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Approach</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The onboarding flow would consist of three sections to capture the
        intent, location and age of a user's kids. By using these three inputs,
        the home feed could be personalized to automatically follow and hide
        certain parenting topics.

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">First Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        I started off by thinking through how a user could express intent for
        the types of local providers they were looking for with a multiselect
        table view.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The location field would be prefilled if the user gave location
        permission after signup. Otherwise location could be entered manually in
        the form of address, city, zip or neighborhood.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Second Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        At this point I explored how to use separate month and year pickers to
        allow users to provide the age of their kids. Once a user applied either
        month or year for a child, the other picker would appear on screen.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The issue with this design was around the error states that would have
        to be displayed if the user only provided month or year.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Mockup -->

    <div class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Shipped Design</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        In the final design, the list of providers in the table view was
        shortened. If a user selected any of the child care options, two
        additional questoins would appear at the bottom of the screen to
        understand what schedule and timing was desired.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        If a user didn't select any of the child care options, then that user
        would not see posts in feed about child care.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Mockup -->
    <div id="margin-below-section" class="content-image">
      <img

      />
    </div>

    <div class="content-body">
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        A user could provide the age of their kids with one bottom sheet
        containing a month and year picker. By default the 'Apply' button would
        be inactive until the user interacted with either the month or year
        picker.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        To edit the age of a particular child, a user could tap on the relevant
        table cell which would bring up a bottom sheet. Multiple children could
        be added and users could remove a child by tapping the minus icon.
      </p>

      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        If users wanted to manage this information at a later time, they could
        go to settings. From there a user could also add, edit and delete the
        age of their kids.
