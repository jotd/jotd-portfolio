      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Overview</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie is a marketplace for child care and backed by a trusted community
        of parents and providers.
      </p>
      <span class="text-subheader-1 highlight">project</span>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie's home feed needed a redesign in order to help users search and
        discover local child care providers. Based on support tickets and App
        Store Reviews, it was clear users were confused by seeeing a feed
        consisting entirely of parenting discussions. Instead users expected to
        find local daycares and preschools immediately after opening the app.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Although Winnie was making a big investment to collect local child care
        data across different markets, it was not being surfaced in the home
        feed. This created a negative experience for new users who were
        presented with a feed of discussions instead of affordances for local
        search and discovery. Monetization was also a consideration because
        child care providers pay to be promoted in search results. So additional
        advertising inventory could be created in the home feed.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        My hypothesis was that If I added affordances for local search and
        discovery to the home feed then I could increase the number of place
        searches as well as place detail views. As a result, the home feed
        experience would match user expectations and paying partners could reach
        more potential customers.
      </p>
      <span class="text-subheader-1 highlight">results</span>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        72% vs. 42% of new users completed a local search in their first app
        session. This +30% lift reflected that new users could search and
        discover local places faster, right from the home feed.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-results" class="text-body">
        The number of place detail views did not meaningfully increase because
        the CTR from search results to place detail stayed flat. So even though
        users were creating more searches, they were not seeing results that
        matched their intent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="margin-below-results" class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Survey Data</h3>

      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        To inform my design decisions, I surveyed a random sample of 1K users
        who had used the iOS app in the past three months.
      </p>
      <!-- <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
      After closing the survey, I exported the email addresses of respondents and matched them with internal user data. 
      This allowed me to segment responses by location.
    </p> -->
      <div class="text-subheader-1">key insights</div>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        A majority of users said their goal in using Winnie was to find local
        child care and activities which made sense since Winnie's maine value
        prop is local data.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Only 18% of users said they wanted advice or support from other parents.
        This made me realize that I could push down UGC in the home feed since
        most users didn't find value in it.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        A majority said they wanted to use search queries (14%) and explore a
        map (26%) to see a ranked list of local providers. This meant that
        shortcuts to create search queries and explore a map could potentially
        be added to the top of feed.

    <div class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Approach</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        At the top of feed, a user would be able to quickly create a search
        based on intent. Below search affordances, a user could browse local
        providers. The rest of feed would show parenting discussions and static
        resources.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">First Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        I started off by exploring different ways to display search shortcut
        buttons which served two purposes. Not only could users see search
        results faster but they would also understand the variety of local data
        that was available for search.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Displaying "filtered" search buttons such as Montessori didn't make
        sense because we didn't have strong data collection in every major
        market. As a result, lots of users would end up in an undesirable low
        data or empty state.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Mockup -->
    <div id="margin-below-section" class="content-image">

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Second Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Then I delved into different ways to help users discover local places
        and also manage places that they had previously viewed and saved.
        However due to backend engineering constraints, it was out of scope to
        show viewed places.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        To increase CTR from feed to place detail, I proposed personalizing the
        places shown in the segmented control based on their search intent.
        During onboarding users can state what types of local providers they are
        looking for. The default state would show a mix of child care and kids
        activities.

      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The Nearby button launches a full screen map view with a carousel of
        places. As a user scrolls through the carousel, the associated map pin
        scales up to provide feedback. The other search buttons would trigger a
        search with results based on the category.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Below the search shortcuts, a segmented control would allow the user to
        toggle between featured and viewed places. The default state for the
        featured places section would show local child care providers based on
        the user's device location. Some randomness and a quality filter
        (description, reviews) was added so this section felt curated. If the
        device location couldn't be detected then the user's home location would
        be used. If no places are found, the radius would be expanded until the
        max limit is reached.
