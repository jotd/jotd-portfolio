      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie is a marketplace for child care and backed by a trusted community
        of parents and providers.
      </p>
      <span class="text-subheader-1 highlight">project</span>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie's search filter experience needed to be enhanced in order to
        increase place detail views. Analytics showed that users who applied
        filters to their searches created more searches on average and had a
        significantly higher CTR from search results to place detail.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The majority of users didn't utilize filters because the affordance was
        hidden behind an icon in the search tab's navbar. This meant that most
        users were not seeing relevant search results so they chose not to
        click-through to place detail. Monetization was an important
        consideration because large child care centers pay for referrals (lead
        generation).
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        My hypothesis was that if the utlization and variety of search filters
        was increased then it would result in more searches and place detail
        views. As a result, users would see more relevant search results and
        child care centers would receive more qualified leads.
      </p>
      <span class="text-subheader-1 highlight">results</span>
      <p class="text-body">
        The data showed that users were twice as likely to do a filtered child
        care search and twice as likely to click through from search.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-results" class="text-body">
        When the hours filter was included in a search, the CTR to place detail
        was 88%. However when the hours filter was not included in a search, the
        CTR dropped to 42%.

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">First Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        I started off by exploring different ways to expose search filter
        categories in the UI using a chip pattern. Along the way I thought of
        creating two new filter categories – price and hours because the data
        was already available on the backend.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Price data was only available in specific markets so a majority of users
        would see an empty state if they tried to apply it to their search.
        However data for an hours filter was available across many different
        markets because it's more standardized than price and easier to collect.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Within each filter category, the options would be multi-select
        checkboxes but the hours filter would be single-select radio buttons.
        The reset button would only appear if at least one filter was applied
        and would remove all applied filters.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Second Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Once I knew which filter chips would be surfaced to users, I explored
        how the options for each type of filter would be displayed. Initially I
        thought of using a classic modal without dividers but ultimately the tap
        targets were too small. Dividers were needed to clearly delineate
        sections for usability.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Another idea was to display filter options as circles within a bottom
        sheet. Circles weren't feasible long term because they limited how much
        text could be displayed inside. The bottom sheet pattern was much better
        than a modal because of better accessiblity since its anchored to the
        bottom of the screen and easier to tap.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Ultimately I went with a bottom sheet that displayed filter options
        inside of a table view with dividers because of accessibility and
        familiarity.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Third Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        At this point, I needed to iron out how a user could filter by custom
        hours. Users could filter by a specific start time, end time or both
        using a slider. The start time limit would be 6AM and the end time limit
        would be 9PM. Each knob would increase or decrease time in one hour
        increments.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The overnight, weeekend and after care options were shortcuts for start
        and end times that a user couldn't apply using the custom hours filter.
        Since radio buttons can't be deselected, the 'Any Hours' option would
        return users to the default state which includes all possible hours.
      </p>

      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Haptic feedback was added to each filter chip to create a sense of
        delight and encourage users to apply more filters so they see the most
        relevant search results. With more time I would've pushed to add a swip
        to dismiss feature for the bottom sheets.
