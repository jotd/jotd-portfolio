        Winnie is the social app that gives parents superpowers! 
        Parents can ask questions, give advice and discover family-friendly businesses. 
    </p>
    <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        I noticed when users browsed each other‚Äôs profiles, they could see posts but replies were excluded. 
        This caused a negative experience because expected behavior is to see all content that another user has created.  
        Turns out the company had punted on designing replies as standalone objects. 
        As a result of this product debt, replies were excluded from profiles and also search results.
    </p>
    <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Analytics showed me that users create five times as many replies as posts. 
        Over half of the replies are created by users that don‚Äôt post at all. 
        This meant that a majority of profiles appeared empty. 
    </p>
    <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-body">
        My hypothesis was that if users see replies on each other‚Äôs profiles and in search results, it would increase the number of page views and time spent in app.
        <b>By designing a solution to this problem, I could positively impact the company's objective of 
        creating a large daily active audience.</b>

    <h3 class="text-subheader-3"> Approach </h3>
    <h2 class="text-subheader-2"> defining scope </h2>
    <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Replies would be surfaced on user profiles (mobile, web) and in search results (mobile only).
        Search results on web would not include replies because it's not universal across both posts and places. 
    </p>
    <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Platforms included iOS, Android and web. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-subheader-2"> parent content </h2>
    <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The first challenge was to figure out what content to include from the parent post. 
        Replies to a discussion include the title whereas replies to a review include a place card 
        as well as the rating and description.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-subheader-2"> reply content </h2>
    <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
      An arrrow icon is included in the user‚Äôs reply to offset the content.  
      This visual treatment gives users feedback while scrolling profiles without
      distracting from the actual content.
    </p>
    <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-body">
      In terms of media attachments, multiple photos appear in a grid. 
      If a reply contains at least one photo and a URL, the link card is hidden. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-wide">
    <!-- <h2 class="text-case-study-h2"> Replies on Profile </h2> -->
    <img src="https://jotsd.s3.amazonaws.com/winnie/profiles/replies-media-attachments.png">
    <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-img-desc">
        Preview of how replies with media attachments appears on user profiles.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-narrow">  
      <h2 class="text-subheader-2"> metadata </h2>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
          I reused the existing metadata patterns from posts on profiles and posts in search results. 
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        
        
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-subheader-2"> overflow menu </h2>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
          The overflow menu options were simplified. The affordance to share a reply outside of the app was removed but a reply could still be reported.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-subheader-2"> engagement actions </h2>
      <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-body">
          Users could like a reply but not reply or bookmark.
          Nested conversations were not supported and the parent post could already be bookmarked.
      </p>
  </div>


    <div class="content-medium">
        <img src="https://jotsd.s3.amazonaws.com/winnie/profiles/public-filled.png">
        <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-img-desc">
            Users can filter by post type to make it easier to scroll profiles
        </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="content-narrow">
        <h2 class="text-subheader-2"> profiles </h2>
        <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-body">
            By default all activity is shown on user profiles, including posts and replies.
            Only the most recent reply is shown if a user creates multiple replies to the same post.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-medium">
        <img src="https://jotsd.s3.amazonaws.com/winnie/profiles/own-empty.png">
        <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-img-desc">
            Empty states for a user's own profile
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-narrow">
        <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
            These empty states contain CTA's prompting users's to post a review, ask a question or answer a question.
            The CTA to leave a review or ask a question deep links to the composer. 
        </p>
        <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
            By default, the user is prompted to review a place because local data is more valuable for monetization than topical data.
            A very specific, easily answerable question that feels subjective is less taxing on the user than asking them to 
            think of their own question. 
        </p>
        <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-body">
            This is because there‚Äôs no wrong answer to the question, it‚Äôs not intimidating, and the user doesn't have to think of something to say.
        </p>
    </div>

        <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
          I successfully shipped this feature across iOS, Android and the web by working side by side with three engineers. 
        </p>
        <div id="" class="text-body">
            Overall, I learned that empty states can be used to prompt users for reviews and new places.   
            Local data can be monetized in a variety of ways in comparison to prompting users to ask questions.
