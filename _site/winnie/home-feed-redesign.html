      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Overview</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie is a marketplace for child care, kids activities and backed by a
        trusted community of parents and providers.
      </p>
      <div class="text-subheader-1">project</div>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Winnie's <span class="highlight"> home feed needed a redesign </span> to
        surface local data. Based on support tickets and App Store Reviews, it
        was clear users were confused by seeeing a feed consisting entirely of
        parenting discussions. Users expected to find local child care and kids
        activities immediately after opening the app but the feed was
        <span class="highlight">
          originally designed for content contribution and engagement.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Although Winnie was making a
        <span class="highlight">big investment to collect local data</span>
        across different markets,
        <span class="highlight"> it was not being surfaced</span> in the home
        feed. This created a negative experience for new users who were
        presented with a feed of discussions instead of affordances for local
        search and discovery. Monetization was also a consideration because
        child care providers paid to be promoted in search results. So
        additional advertising inventory could be created in the home feed.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        <span class="highlight">My hypothesis</span> was that If I added
        affordances for local search and discovery to the home feed then I could
        increase the number of place searches as well as place detail views. As
        a result, the home feed experience would match user expectations and
        paying partners could reach more potential customers.
      </p>
      <div class="text-subheader-1">results</div>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        <span class="highlight"> 72% vs. 42% </span> of new users
        <span class="highlight">completed a local search</span> in their first
        app session. This +30% lift reflected that new users could search and
        discover local places faster, right from the home feed.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-section" class="text-body">
        The number of place detail views did not meaningfully increase because
        the CTR from search results to place detail stayed flat. So even though
        users were creating more searches, they were not seeing results that
        matched their intent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="margin-below-section" class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Survey Data</h3>

      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        To inform my design decisions, I surveyed a random sample of 1K parents
        who had used the iOS app in the past three months.
      </p>
      <!-- <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
      After closing the survey, I exported the email addresses of respondents and matched them with internal user data. 
      This allowed me to segment responses by location.
    </p> -->
      <div class="text-subheader-1">key insights</div>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        A majority of users said their goal in using Winnie was to find local
        child care (8%) and activities (52%) which made sense since Winnie's
        maine value prop is local data.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Only 18% of users said they wanted advice or support from other parents.
        This made me realize that I could push down UGC in the home feed since
        most users didn't find value in it.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        In terms of how users wanted to acommplish this goal, a majority said
        they wanted to use search queries (14%) and explore a map (26%) to see a
        ranked list of results. This meant that shortcuts to create search
        queries and explore a map could be added above the home feed.

      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Approach</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        My strategy for creating a new home feed architecture revolved around
        intent, browse and nurture.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        At the top of feed, a user would be able to quickly create a search
        based on intent. Below search affordances, a user could browse local
        providers for child care and kids activities. The rest of feed would
        show parenting discussions and static resources.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Wireframe -->
    <div id="margin-below-section" class="content-wireframe">

        class="slightly-rounded-corners"

    <div class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">First Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        I started off by exploring different ways to display search shortcut
        buttons which served two purposes. Not only could users see search
        results faster but they would also understand the variety of local data
        that was available for search.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Displaying "filtered" search buttons such as Montessori didn't make
        sense because we don't have strong data collection in every major
        market. As a result, lots of users would end up in an undesirable low
        data or empty state.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Mockup -->
    <div id="margin-below-section" class="content-image">
      <img
        src="https://jotsd.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/winnie/home%20feed%20redesign/first-iteration.png"

    </div>

    <div class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Second Iteration</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Then I delved into different ways to help users discover local places
        and also manage places that they had previously viewed and saved.
        However due to backend engineering constraints, it was out of scope to
        show viewed places.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        To increase CTR from feed to place detail, I proposed personalizing the
        places shown in the segmented control based on their search intent.
        During onboarding, users are shown a simple form where they can use
        checkboxes to state whether they are looking for daycares, preschools,
        kids activitie or drop-in care. The responses to this question were then
        used to populate the segmented control. The default state would show a
        mix of child care and kids activities.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body"></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Mockup -->
    <div id="margin-below-section" class="content-image">
      <img
        src="https://jotsd.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/winnie/home%20feed%20redesign/second-iteration.png"
      />
    </div>

    <div class="content-body">
      <h3 class="text-subheader-3">Shipped Design</h3>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The Nearby button launches a full screen map view with a carousel of
        places. As a user scrolls through the carousel, the associated map pin
        scales up to provide feedback. In terms of visual treatment, the active
        map pin would have a white icon against a colored background for
        contrast against inactive map pins. The point of each map pin would
        denote the latitutde and longitude.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        The other search buttons would trigger a search with results based on
        the category such as Daycares, Preschools, Activities etc. Below the
        search shortcuts, I placed a segmented control allowing the user to
        toggle between featured and viewed places. The default state for the
        featured places section would be local child care and kids activities
        based on the user's device location. Some randomness and a quality
        filter (description, reviews) was added so this section felt curated to
        users. If the device location can't be detected then the user's home
        location captured in onboarding would be used. If no places are found,
        the radius would be expanded until the max limit is reached. If no
        places are found after reaching the max radius, then the segmented
        control would be hidden altogether.
      </p>
      <p id="margin-below-sentence" class="text-body">
        Furthermore, the places that populate the carousel would be personalized
        based on onboarding. If a user has no saved places, there would be a
        prompt urging the user to create a search to discover local places.
        Tapping on the prompt would take the user to the search tab.
      </p>
