      <h1 class="header-about">Hello, I'm Jot.</h1>
      <p class="text-2">
        I'm at Product Manager based in the Bay Area with 10 yrs of experience shipping, designing and researching consumer software across mobile, social and payments @ Gemini, Square, Snapchat and Twitter.

Most recently I was at Gemini, where I worked on the mobile platform. Before that, I was at Square where I designed the Afterpay Loyalty Program from 0 to 1 and expanded the design system for the shopping team.

Prior to that, I was the first product hire at Winnie, where I worked on messaging, home feed and search. Earlier in my career, I was a User Researcher for Snapchat and Twitter.

My B.A. degree from Cal Berkeley is in Political Science & Legal Studies with a minor in Education and a concentration in Public Policy. To refine my craft, I also studied Product Design at ArtCenter through sketching, 3D modeling & prototyping.
